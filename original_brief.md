* HTML
* CSS

* You must parse an input file of forthcoming Cruises and display the results on the page.
* Because of the amount of results you should only load so many results on the screen at a time. 
* Then use some kind of AJAX/JavaScript technique to load the rest of the results in chunks/stages.
* Use CSS, HTML and/or JavaScript  to display the results in an organised/tidy fashion and so that it 
* responds well whether viewing on a Desktop or Mobile Device (Android/IOS).
